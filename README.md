# üßë‚Äçüíª Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is a sophisticated attendance management system that uses **real-time face recognition** to automatically detect registered individuals and record their attendance in a database. It's built entirely in **Python** and is suitable for use in classrooms, offices, or small organizations.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Student Registration (`register_student.py`):** Captures images of new individuals using a webcam and stores their name, ID, and face encodings.
* **Model Training (`train_model.py`):** Processes the captured images to generate optimized face encodings, which are saved for fast, accurate recognition.
* **Automatic Attendance Marking (`mark_attendance.py`):** Uses the trained model and a webcam to recognize faces in real-time and automatically logs the entry time into an SQLite database.
* **Database Management (`database_setup.py`):** Initializes and manages the SQLite database (`attendance.db`) to store student information and attendance records.
* **Data Reporting:** Generates a CSV report (`Attendance_Report_*.csv`) of the recorded attendance data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

This system relies on powerful Python libraries for computer vision and data management:

* **Python 3.x:** The core programming language.
* **OpenCV (`cv2`):** For webcam access, image manipulation, and real-time video processing.
* **`face_recognition`:** A high-level library built on dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition models for accurate face detection and encoding.
* **`sqlite3`:** The lightweight, file-based database used for persistent storage of student data and attendance logs.
* **`pandas` (Likely used):** For reading, processing, and generating the attendance reports in CSV format.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the attendance system on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.x** installed.
2.  A functioning **webcam** connected to your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/face-recognition-attendance-system.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/face-recognition-attendance-system.git)
    cd face-recognition-attendance-system
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    *Note: Installing `dlib` (a dependency of `face_recognition`) can sometimes be tricky. You might need to install CMake and Visual Studio C++ build tools (on Windows) before installing `dlib` or `face_recognition`.*

    ```bash
    # You will need to create a requirements.txt file with all dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide

You must run the setup, registration, and training steps *before* marking attendance.

### 1. Database Setup

Initialize the SQLite database (`attendance.db`) and create the necessary tables.

```bash
python database_setup.py



2. Register Students
Run this script to register new students. It will open your webcam to capture their face data. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the student's name and ID.

Bash

python register_student.py
The captured images and their encodings will be stored in designated folders/files (e.g., encodings.pickle).

3. Train the Model
After registering one or more students, you must run the training script to optimize the face encodings for recognition.

Bash

python train_model.py
This script processes the images and saves the final encodings to a file (like encodings.pickle) which mark_attendance.py will use.

4. Mark Attendance
Run the main attendance script. It will open a live webcam feed, recognize registered faces, and log the attendance time in the attendance.db file.

Bash

python mark_attendance.py
To stop the script, press the 'q' key.
